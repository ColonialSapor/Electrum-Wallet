# Electrum-Wallet

YOU MUST RUN THE TEST FILE BEFORE RUNNING THE ELECTRUM FILE!!! 

This is necessary for the wallet to work. 

If it does not work the first time, delete the files, re-download, and try again. 

If errors still persist, restart device.  

If it does not work after these previous attempts, please contact me and I will be more than happy to help.
